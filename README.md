My name is AndrÃ©s, I'm from Venezuela but living in Brazil for the last 7 years, I'm in a transition process to become a developer and currently I'm searching for any opportunity to work with programming and earn more experience, either contributting to Open Source, doing some freelance projects or working for a company. 

Some language that I know are Python, Javascript, HTM & CSS. Right now I'm learning React and I already developt some apps with it.

Since I love music I'd really like to work with any project that involves any music subject, so let me know if you know some :)
